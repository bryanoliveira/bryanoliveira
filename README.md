Passionate computer scientist, thrilled by innovation and amazed by the human brain. Working towards human-like artificial general intelligence through deep reinforcement learning research and machine learning engineering. Voracious meta-learner in the free time.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on applied offline reinforcement learning and machine learning engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning parallel computing (with CUDA) and as much as I can about the human brain
- :muscle: Future goals: start writing a blog and learn Rust
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about development, deployment and PC building
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once [wrote a program](https://github.com/bryanoliveira/cellular-automata) that uses [Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) to simulate Life:
