Passionate computer scientist, thrilled by innovation and amazed by the human brain. Interested in high-performance computing and working towards artificial general intelligence through deep reinforcement learning research and machine learning engineering. Voracious meta-learner in the free time.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on applied offline reinforcement learning and machine learning engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning parallel computing (with CUDA) and as much as I can about the human brain
- :muscle: Future goals: start writing a blog and build my own game engine from scratch
- 💬 Ask me about development, deployment and PC building
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote [a program](https://github.com/bryanoliveira/cellular-automata) that could simulate [Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) _within_ Life itself:
