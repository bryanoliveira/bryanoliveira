Passionate computer scientist, thrilled by innovation and amazed by the human brain. Interested in high-performance computing and working towards artificial general intelligence through deep reinforcement learning research and machine learning engineering. Voracious meta-learner in the free time.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning engineering and reinforcement learning research applied to debt collection.
- ðŸŒ± I'm always learning, as I find that constantly expanding my horizons helps to boost my creativity.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AI, how we can draw inspiration from the brain, and philosophical questions about it.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once wrote [a program](https://github.com/bryanoliveira/cellular-automata) that could simulate [Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) _within_ Life itself:
